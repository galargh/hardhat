## 3.0.0-next.4

### Patch Changes

- b3982a2: Add Arbitrum Sepolia to chain config in Ignition ([#6518](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/pull/6518))
- 7c9ad25: Infer and display better error messages from stack traces ([#6505](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/6505))
- 0a96da8: feat: bump @ignored/edr to 0.10.0-alpha.2. This brings two improvements:

  1. Better error messages when invoking unsupported cheatcodes. Previously we'd just return "unknown selector 0xafc98040", now we return "cheatcode 'broadcast()' is not supported" instead.
  2. Automatically linking libraries for Solidity tests.
